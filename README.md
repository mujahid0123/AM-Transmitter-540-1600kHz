# AM Transmitter (540–1600 kHz)

## 📌 Project Overview
This project demonstrates the design and implementation of a **low-power AM (Amplitude Modulation) transmitter** operating in the **540–1600 kHz medium-wave band**. The objective was to understand the principles of AM transmission through practical circuit design, simulation, and hardware implementation.

The project was completed as part of an undergraduate electronics course.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Design a functional AM transmitter
- Understand amplitude modulation principles
- Generate carrier signals using LC oscillators and 555 timer IC
- Analyze modulation behavior using simulation tools
- Implement and test circuits on breadboard

## 🧠 Technical Description
Three design approaches were explored:

### 1️⃣ Transistor-Based Oscillator
- LC tank circuit using inductor and variable capacitor
- Regenerative feedback for oscillation
- Audio signal modulation through transistor stages  
⚠️ Attempt limited by component availability

### 2️⃣ 555 Timer IC Based AM Transmitter
- Carrier generation using 555 timer IC
- Frequency tuning using variable resistor
- Modulation attempted through control voltage (Pin 5)

### 3️⃣ Improved Design with Separate Modulator
- Independent modulation stage
- Improved AM output observed in simulation
- Final output verified using Proteus simulation
